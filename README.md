CoreMediaIO Camera Extensions are a great addition to macOS.
In addition, ScreenCaptureKit allows capturing several windows at 60 FPS without overloading the CPU.
These 2 technologies are made for Screegle! https://www.appblit.com/screegle

Here I'll post macOS and Swift tips I've learned while developing my side-project Screegle.

One sample is https://github.com/ldenoue/cameraextension
